# A4 — Acceptance (Purge hooks + admin endpoint)

- POST /tag/_purge with action=tenant and valid X-Tenant-Id → 200, returns stats per root.
- action=tag_ids with list → 200, purges only matching IDs.
- action=all → 200, purges everything inside allowed roots.
- Safety: attempts to purge outside allowed roots are ignored.
- With A1 enabled, /tag/_purge is protected by signature middleware.
