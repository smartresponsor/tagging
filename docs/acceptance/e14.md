# E14 Acceptance Notes
- Ensure schema applied: run the engine-specific script (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- Verify uniqueness: create two tags with same slug -> expect 409/validation error.
- Verify index usage: run EXPLAIN on list/facet/cloud queries (DDL provides covering indexes).
- Verify delete guard: attempt to delete a tag that has relations/assignments -> expect restriction or redirect flow.
