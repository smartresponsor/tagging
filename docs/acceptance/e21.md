# E21 Acceptance
1) Sign a request with current secret; GET/POST passes (tag_sig_ok_total increments).
2) Change secret to previous and re-sign; still passes.
3) Send same nonce twice within window → 403 replay_detected.
4) Send with timestamp older than 10 minutes → 401 timestamp_skew.
5) Send with wrong signature → 401 signature_invalid.
