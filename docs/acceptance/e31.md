# E31 Acceptance

- Search tab works end-to-end: GET /tag/search?q=... returns 200 and JSON list.
- Assignments: POST /tag/{id}/assign and /unassign return counters; list lists items for entity.
- Synonyms: GET/POST/DELETE on /tag/{id}/synonym function as specified.
- HMAC V2 headers are attached; missing secret or tenant yields backend error as expected.
- Keyboard shortcuts operate; config persists via localStorage.
