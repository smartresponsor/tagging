# E5 — Acceptance (Observability & SLO Gate)

- Grafana dashboard renders RPS, latency p95, errors, cache-hit (search).
- Prometheus rules loaded; alerts fire under thresholds (test by raising limits).
- `tools/synthetic/tag-slo-gate.sh` exits non-zero if p95>0.25s or error_rate>0.5% against BASE_URL.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/slo-gate.yml` runs the script with inputs and fails build on breach.
